1)Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model for real estate prices based on the Boston Housing dataset. The dataset includes various features such as crime rate, average number of rooms, and property tax rates, all of which influence the median value of homes in the Boston area. Using this data, a machine learning model is built to predict home values with high accuracy, making use of the following techniques:

Data preprocessing (handling missing values and feature scaling)
Feature engineering and selection
Regression model training (Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression)
Hyperparameter optimization
Cross-validation and performance evaluation

2)Installation
To run this project, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

scikit-learn (for machine learning algorithms)
numpy (for numerical operations)
pandas (for data manipulation)
matplotlib and seaborn (for data visualization)

To install the required dependencies, use the following command:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Alternatively, install each package manually:
pip install scikit-learn numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn

3)Dataset
This project uses the Boston Housing dataset, which is readily available in scikit-learn. The dataset comprises 506 samples, each containing 13 feature variables and a target variable representing the median value of homes in the Boston area. Key features include:

Crime rate
Average number of rooms
Property tax rate
Proximity to employment centers

4)Implementation Details
4.1. Data Preprocessing
Missing value imputation and handling outliers
Feature scaling (Standardization using StandardScaler)
4.2. Feature Engineering
Exploration of feature correlations
Creation of new features based on domain knowledge (if applicable)
Encoding categorical features (if needed)
4.3. Model Training
Regression models implemented: Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression
Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
Cross-validation to ensure robustness of the model
4.4. Model Evaluation
Performance metrics used: Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-Squared (R²)
Comparison of models to select the best performer

5)Performance Evaluation
The model was evaluated using the following metrics:

Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures the average of the squared differences between predicted and actual values.
R-Squared (R²): Indicates the proportion of variance in the target variable that is predictable from the features.
The model achieves a strong prediction accuracy, with optimized hyperparameters providing robust results in cross-validation tests.
